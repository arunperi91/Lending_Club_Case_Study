## General Information
- Lending club is the largest peer-to-peer marketplace connecting borrowers with lenders. Borrowers apply through an online platform where they are assigned an internal score.
- Some popular products are credit card loans, debt consolidation loans, house loans, car loans, etc.
- For this we will be using the loan dataset provided to identify the variables which might help us for better decision making for loan lending.

1. Grade
